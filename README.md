Models from the paper [Montagud, A. et al. (2022) Patient-specific Boolean models of signalling networks guide personalised treatments. eLife, 11, e72626.](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72626) can be found in the `prostate` folder. 
The generic model was personalised using mutation and RNAseq data to produce the cell line-specific models of the `cell lines` folder.
