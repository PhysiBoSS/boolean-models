# Boolean models repository
A model repository of published Boolean models of cell signaling and regulatory networks.

## Prostate cancer models
Models of the prostate carcinoma from the paper [Montagud, A. et al. (2022) Patient-specific Boolean models of signalling networks guide personalised treatments. eLife, 11, e72626.](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72626) can be found in the `prostate cancer` folder ready to be used in PhysiBoSS. 
The generic model was personalised using mutation and RNAseq data to produce the cell line-specific models of the `cell lines` folder.

## Gastric cancer model
Model of the gastric adenocarcinoma AGS cell line from the paper [Flobak, Ã…. et al. (2015) Discovery of Drug Synergies in Gastric Cancer Cells Predicted by Logical Modeling. PLOS Computational Biology, 11, e1004426.](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004426) can be found in the `gastric cancer` folder ready to be used in PhysiBoSS. 

## TNF Cell Fate Model
Model of cell fate decision recapitulating and integrating the most consistent interactions extracted from the literature which provides a generic high-level view of the interplays between NFkappaB pro-survival pathway, RIP1-dependent necrosis, and the apoptosis pathway in response to death receptor-mediated signals from the paper [Calzone L, et al (2010) Mathematical modelling of cell-fate decision in response to death receptor engagement. PLoS Computational Biology. 6, e1000702.](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000702) can be found in the `TNF Cell Fate` folder ready to be used in PhysiBoSS.
